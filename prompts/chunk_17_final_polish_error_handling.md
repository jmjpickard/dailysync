# Chunk 17: Final Polish, Error Handling, and Cleanup

**Goal:** Refine the overall application UX, improve error handling, add missing loading states, ensure proper cleanup of temporary files, and address any remaining inconsistencies.

**Context:** This final phase focuses on improving the robustness, usability, and stability of the application based on the implemented features.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Comprehensive Error Handling:**

    - **Review All IPC:** Ensure all `invoke` calls have `.catch()` blocks in the renderer to handle errors rejected from the main process (API failures, file system errors, permission errors, etc.). Display user-friendly messages.
    - **Review Main Process Logic:** Add `try...catch` blocks around critical operations (file I/O, API calls, native module calls, `child_process` execution). Log errors internally and communicate user-facing errors back to the renderer.
    - **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases: What if a meeting is deleted from Google Calendar? What if the `userData` directory is corrupted? Network offline? Disk full? Handle these gracefully where possible.
    - **User Feedback:** Replace generic error alerts with more specific, informative messages within the UI context (e.g., inline messages in the relevant pane).

2.  **Loading Indicators:**

    - Review the application flow for any operations that might take noticeable time (fetching calendar events, loading notes/transcripts, generating summaries, initial authentication).
    - Ensure consistent loading indicators (spinners, skeleton loaders, status messages) are displayed during these operations to provide feedback.

3.  **UI Consistency and Polish:**

    - **Layout & Styling:** Review overall layout, spacing, typography, button styles, color scheme for consistency and visual appeal.
    - **Tooltips:** Add tooltips to buttons or icons where the function isn't immediately obvious (e.g., Record button if disabled, LLM selection).
    - **Empty States:** Ensure all panes/sections have clear empty states (e.g., "No events today", "No notes added yet", "Select a meeting to see details").
    - **Responsiveness (Basic):** Ensure the layout doesn't break completely on slightly different window sizes (though focus is macOS desktop).

4.  **Temporary File Cleanup:**

    - **Verify:** Double-check that all temporary audio files (`temp_system_audio`, `temp_mic_audio`, `temp_mixed_audio`) are reliably deleted by the transcription worker (Chunk 10) after successful transcription or terminal failure.
    - **Orphaned Files:** Consider adding a cleanup routine on app startup to remove any old temporary audio files left over from previous crashes (e.g., files older than a day in the temp directory with a specific naming pattern).

5.  **Code Quality and Refactoring:**

    - Review code for clarity, comments, consistency.
    - Refactor duplicated code into reusable functions/modules.
    - Ensure proper asynchronous handling (async/await, Promises).
    - Check for potential memory leaks (e.g., unremoved event listeners, large objects held in memory).

6.  **Testing:**
    - Manually test all core workflows on macOS: Authentication, event display, date navigation, recording (various scenarios - short, long, stop immediately), transcription queueing, notes, summarization (each LLM), settings changes, permission handling (grant/deny), error conditions (e.g., disconnect network during API call).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Unhandled errors are minimized; user-facing errors are informative.
- Loading states provide clear feedback during long operations.
- UI is visually consistent and easy to navigate.
- Temporary files are consistently cleaned up.
- Core workflows function reliably under various conditions.
- Codebase is reasonably clean and maintainable.

**Technologies:** Primarily involves reviewing and refining existing code across all previous chunks. Focus on TypeScript (Error handling, async), CSS (Styling), Electron APIs (IPC, Shell, etc.).
