# AI Agent Task: Refactor Electron Path Logic for Worker Threads

## Context

We have an Electron application that uses Node.js `worker_threads` for background tasks (transcription). A module (`src/transcription/paths.ts`) was responsible for determining file paths for dependencies (executables, models) based on whether the app is running in development or production (packaged).

This module was refactored to remove its direct dependency on the `electron` module (specifically `app.isPackaged`) when running inside the worker, by intending to read this information from `workerData`.

However, this refactored `paths.ts` is also being imported/required by code running in the **main process**, causing the following error on application load because `workerData` is null/undefined in the main process context:

TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'isPackagedEnvironment' of 'worker_threads_1.workerData' as it is null.
at Object.<anonymous> (/path/to/dist/transcription/paths.js:18:9)
...

The line causing the error in the refactored `paths.ts` is:

```typescript
const { isPackagedEnvironment, assetsPath } = workerData as PathWorkerData;
Goal
Refactor the code to correctly separate the path resolution logic:

Code needing Electron APIs (app.isPackaged) should run only in the main process.
Code running inside the worker thread should get necessary environment information (like base paths or package status) via workerData.
Eliminate the TypeError caused by accessing workerData outside the worker context.
Files Involved
src/transcription/paths.ts (Current problematic version using workerData)
src/transcription/queue.ts (Creates the worker, needs modification to pass workerData)
src/main.ts (Main process entry point, potentially imports path logic indirectly)
Any files required by the worker script (src/transcription/worker.js) that import from paths.ts (e.g., src/transcription/audio-mixer.ts).
Current Code Snippets
Current src/transcription/paths.ts (Problematic - Uses workerData at top level):

TypeScript

// NOTE: This is the version causing the TypeError when loaded by main process
import path from 'path';
import fs from 'fs';
// Error happens because 'electron' cannot be imported, BUT ALSO because
// workerData is accessed at the top level, causing TypeError when main loads this file.
// import { app } from 'electron'; // This was removed, but illustrates the previous state
import { workerData } from 'worker_threads';

interface PathWorkerData {
  isPackagedEnvironment: boolean;
  assetsPath: string; // Expecting base assets path
}
// THIS LINE CAUSES THE TypeError in main process context
const { isPackagedEnvironment, assetsPath } = workerData as PathWorkerData;

export interface WhisperModel { /* ... */ }
export interface TranscriptionDependencies { /* ... */ }

export function getWhisperPath(): string {
  return path.join(assetsPath, 'main');
}

export function getFFmpegPath(): string {
   return path.join(assetsPath, 'bin', 'ffmpeg', 'ffmpeg');
}

export function getWhisperModelPath(modelName: string): string {
    return path.join(assetsPath, 'models', 'whisper', modelName);
}
// ... other functions using assetsPath or isPackagedEnvironment ...
Current src/transcription/queue.ts (Relevant createWorker function snippet - Needs workerData):

TypeScript

// Snippet from src/transcription/queue.ts
import { app } from 'electron'; // app is available here
import { Worker } from 'worker_threads';
import path from 'path';
// ... other imports

function createWorker(): void {
    // ... (error handling, path calculation for workerPath)
    const workerPath = path.join(__dirname, 'worker.js');

    // TODO: Determine isPackaged, assetsPath using Electron 'app' HERE
    // TODO: Pass determined values via workerData

    console.log(`[Worker Create] Calling 'new Worker()' for script: ${workerPath}`);

    // Pass workerData here
    worker = new Worker(workerPath, {
        workerData: {
            // Need to populate this correctly from main process info
            // isPackagedEnvironment: ???,
            // assetsPath: ???
        }
    });

    console.log('[Worker Create] Worker instance created successfully. Setting up listeners...');
    // ... (listener setup) ...
}

// ... rest of queue.ts
Refactoring Steps
Please implement the following changes:

Create src/transcription/main-paths.ts:

This file will run only in the main process context.
It should import app from electron.
It should export functions to get the package status and relevant base paths using app.isPackaged and process.resourcesPath.
Provide the full code for this new file.
Rename src/transcription/paths.ts to src/transcription/worker-paths.ts:

This file will run only inside the worker thread.
It must not import electron.
It should import workerData from worker_threads.
It should read the necessary information (like assetsPath) from workerData (ensure this read happens safely, perhaps inside functions if top-level access remains problematic, though fixing the import context should solve the primary error).
It should export the path-generating functions (getWhisperPath, getFFmpegPath, etc.) using the information from workerData.
Provide the full code for this modified/renamed file.
Modify src/transcription/queue.ts:

Import the necessary functions/values (like getIsPackagedFlag, getMainProcessAssetsPath) from the new src/transcription/main-paths.ts.
Inside the createWorker function, call these imported functions to get the actual package status and base assets path.
Pass these values correctly inside the workerData object when creating the new Worker.
Provide the updated createWorker function block from src/transcription/queue.ts.
Update Imports in Worker Context:

Identify any files that are part of the worker's dependency tree (e.g., src/transcription/worker.js, src/transcription/audio-mixer.ts) which previously imported from './paths'.
Change these imports to use './worker-paths' instead.
Please list the files you identify and modify, showing the changed import line. If you cannot know the exact files, please state that this step is necessary and show an example.
Expected Output
Provide the complete code content for the following files after implementing the refactoring:

src/transcription/main-paths.ts (New file)
src/transcription/worker-paths.ts (Renamed and confirmed working with workerData)
src/transcription/queue.ts (Specifically the updated createWorker function and any new imports at the top)
A list of any other files modified to update imports, showing the change (or an example if exact files unknown).
```
