Objective: Migrate remaining utility functions, refine existing code, improve type safety, and perform a final styling review.

Context: Most core functionality is migrated. This stage focuses on cleanup and any missed utilities.

Task:

1.  **Migrate Utilities:**
    - Review the original `renderer.ts` for any utility functions not yet migrated (e.g., `extractMeetingLink` if missed, `debounce` if not done). Move them to appropriate files in `src/renderer/src/utils/` and ensure they are exported/imported correctly.
2.  **Type Safety:**
    - Review all components, hooks, and context definitions. Ensure TypeScript types are used consistently and accurately represent the data (replace `any` where possible). Define clear types for complex objects like `CalendarEvent`, `TranscriptionState`, `AppSettings`, etc., in `src/renderer/src/types/index.ts`. Verify the `electron.d.ts` types match the preload script accurately.
3.  **Code Cleanup:**
    - Remove unused variables, imports, or commented-out code.
    - Ensure consistent code formatting (consider using Prettier).
    - Check for console logs left over from debugging.
4.  **Styling Refinement:**
    - Review the application's appearance. Ensure Tailwind CSS classes are applied consistently and achieve the desired look and feel. Check responsiveness if applicable.
    - Ensure loading states, disabled states, and error states are visually clear.
5.  **Error Handling:**
    - Review IPC calls (`useIpcInvoke`) and other asynchronous operations. Ensure potential errors are caught (`.catch()` or try/catch) and handled gracefully (e.g., updating state, showing notifications/dialogs).
