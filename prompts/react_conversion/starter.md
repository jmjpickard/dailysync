Hi Claude. We're resuming the Electron renderer refactoring project we started previously.

**Project Recap:** We are migrating an Electron app's renderer process from a large vanilla TypeScript file (`renderer.ts`) to a modern React + TypeScript application. We decided on using `electron-vite` for the build process, React Context API for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling. We have an existing main process with the necessary IPC handlers.

**Progress Update:** We have successfully completed phase1 through 13. You can find detail in the prompts in /prompts/react_conversion

**Next Step:** We are now ready to begin **phase 14**: please find detail in phase14.md

Please implement phase 14
